# 3D Cylinder with Three.js and React

This project demonstrates how to create and render a **3D cylinder** using **Three.js** with **React** and **@react-three/fiber**. The project features real-time rendering of the cylinder, texture mapping, lighting effects, and user interaction through orbit controls.

## About

This project is a simple implementation of **Three.js** with **React** to create a 3D interactive **cylinder**. The cylinder can be rotated, zoomed, and viewed from different angles using mouse controls.

### Key Concepts:
- **Three.js** is used to create the 3D objects and environment.
- **React Three Fiber** integrates Three.js with React, making it easier to manage components and rendering.
- **@react-three/drei** is used to add useful utilities like orbit controls and textures.

---

## Features

- **3D Cylinder Geometry:** A dynamic cylinder rendered in real-time.
- **Texture Mapping:** You can apply custom textures (e.g., `AI.png`) on the surface of the cylinder.
- **Lighting:** Includes ambient lighting to showcase the 3D object with proper shading.
- **Orbit Controls:** Users can interact with the cylinder (rotate and zoom).
- **Responsive Design:** Works well across different screen sizes.

---

## Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for 3D graphics.
- **React Three Fiber**: React renderer for Three.js.
- **@react-three/drei**: Helper library for React Three Fiber, providing common tools like OrbitControls.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/3d-cylinder-threejs-react.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd 3d-cylinder-threejs-react
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the project**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **View the app**:
   Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the 3D cylinder in action.
